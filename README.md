TU Eats: Towson Universities First Food Ordering Mobile App

TU Eats is our on campus food ordering platform that makes picking up food from your favorite on campus eatery.
This is all done while being easier, cheaper, and more accessible than other food related apps on the market.

To Test:
- Open TUeats.xcodeproj using X-Code, and run the project using the built in X-code simulator (Optimized for iPhone 13 Pro Max and iOS 15.4)
- Select "login as guest" on the login page

Initial Release Features:
- There are four eatery options to choose from (more choices will be coming in future updates)
- Anyone within the main campus will be able to order within that eateries open hours
- All payments will be hosted by ApplePay
    - For the purpose of a prototype, a payment system will not be added in order to test active orders
- Users will be able to use TU Eats regardless of their affiliation with Towson (login for existing/new users will be available in future updates)
    - This means only "Login as Guest" functionality exists, and providing a TUID  will be required to make a purchase (And will be verified via a OneCard or phone by the TU Eatery)
- Option to add items from each restaurant to the cart
- Users will only be able to order from one eatery for the same order (cannot order from more than one eatery in the same order)
